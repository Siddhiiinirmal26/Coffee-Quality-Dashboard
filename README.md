# Coffee Quality Dashboard: Sensory Attributes Analysis
## Project Overview:
###  This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of coffee quality based on sensory attributes. By comparing various sensory scores such as aroma, flavor, acidity, and body, this project aims to highlight key determinants of coffee quality and understand the sensory profiles that distinguish high-quality coffee from lower-quality options. The data insights are visualized through interactive charts to assist users in interpreting the sensory attributes of coffee effectively.

## Data Source
The data used in this analysis includes sensory attributes scores for coffee samples, along with overall quality ratings. For this project:

## High-Quality Coffee is defined as coffee with Total Cup Points > 80.
## Low-Quality Coffee includes samples with Total Cup Points â‰¤ 80.
## Dashboard Visualizations

## The dashboard contains the following key visualizations:
#### Grouped Bar Chart: Sensory Attributes by Coffee Quality

### Compares the average scores of each sensory attribute between high-quality and low-quality coffee samples.
### Helps identify which attributes (e.g., aroma, acidity) contribute most significantly to high-quality coffee.
### Line Chart: Sensory Attribute Trends by Coffee Quality

Dot Plot: Average Sensory Scores

Each sensory attribute is plotted with dots representing high and low-quality average scores.
Useful for quickly identifying the gaps in sensory scores between high and low-quality coffee.
Total Cup Points Distribution

Visualizes the distribution of Total Cup Points to show the spread of coffee quality ratings.
Key Findings
Attributes Contribution: Certain sensory attributes such as aroma and body show higher scores in high-quality coffee samples.
Quality Differentiators: The radar-like grouped bar chart clearly shows how high-quality coffee differs in sensory attributes from low-quality coffee, providing insights into the characteristics that define premium coffee.

Future Enhancements
Additional Attributes: Include further attributes such as region, processing method, and price.
Interactive Filters: Add filters for sensory attributes to allow custom exploration.
Comparative Analysis by Region: Expand the dashboard to compare coffee attributes by region.
